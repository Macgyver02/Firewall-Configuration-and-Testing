pfSense is a free and open-source firewall distribution based on FreeBSD. Here's an example of how to configure firewall rules using the pfSense web interface:

Navigate to Firewall > Rules and click on the appropriate interface (e.g., WAN, LAN).
Click on the "Add" button to create a new rule.
Configure the rule settings, such as the protocol (TCP, UDP, or both), source and destination addresses or networks, ports, and the action (Pass or Block).
For example, to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the Internet to a web server on the LAN subnet (192.168.1.0/24), you can create a rule with the following settings:


Action: Pass
Interface: WAN
Protocol: TCP
Source: Any
Destination: 192.168.1.0/24
Destination Port Range: 80,443

Click "Save" to apply the rule.
To test the firewall rules, you can use various tools and commands:

Use the nmap command to scan for open ports from the Internet or another network:

nmap -p- 192.168.1.100 # Scan all ports on the web server


Use the tcpdump command to capture and analyze network traffic:

tcpdump -ni em0 # Capture packets on the WAN interface

Use a web browser or curl command to test HTTP/HTTPS access:

curl http://192.168.1.100
curl https://192.168.1.100
